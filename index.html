<p>
The goal of the SCOPE project is to contribute to the RobMoSys ecosystem by proposing methods and tools to enable the assessment of system-wide safety properties at the behavioral level (the “deliberative layer”) where safe autonomy becomes the key challenge.
With reference to the<a href="https://robmosys.eu/wiki/modeling:metamodels:behavior/"> RobMoSys meta-model for robotic behavior </a>, the goal of SCOPE is to provide tools that analyze and derive properties of a task by composing the properties that describe its skills and the environment, and, at runtime, ensure the correct execution of a task by monitoring it and propagating anomalies detected at the level of the skills.

<p>
The novelty of SCOPE is to use quantitative modelling and specification languages, so that it is possible to reason on real-time constraints, as well as resources, i.e, pre- and post-conditions for the correct execution of a skill deriving from the interaction between skills and software-hardware components sitting below the deliberative layer, plus the external environment which is directly or indirectly affected by the robot.
The tools developed in SCOPE are validated on real-world scenarios using the R1 humanoid robot.
